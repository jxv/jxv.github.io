Through the eyes of a teenager, it was easy to dismiss his classroom disposition as social incompetence or good-hearted aloofness.</p><p>He was a husband, a father, well below average height, with a well kept peppering beard, and a multi-decade teaching history.
Retrospectively, those facts reflected his ability to handle a room of hormonal, growth spurted teenagers.</p><p>Even with the typical lab shenanigans, not once did he show visible anger.
Just remained calm, firm, polite, and consistent.</p><p>Admittedly, I did not like his class.
While I never partook in the tomfooleries, I was exceedingly disengaged.
(Sorry. There's no comeback story. I'm still not an aspiring biologist.)</p><p>It didn't help that my most exciting class preceded his.
To attend his, I descended from a few flights of stairs.
Not far at all.
No real excuse for my habitual avoidance behaviors which approached tardiness.</p><p>Unexpectedly, that class may have grown into being one of my most influential classes.
The reason has nothing to do with the grand subject of Biology.
And as he predicted, I don't recall a goddamn grade.
What I do recall was very annoying.</p><p>When a student asked a relevant question, he frequently responded with a demoralizing quip .
The typical exchange would go as follows.</p><p>The student innocently asks &quot;Teacher, what's the powerhouse of a cell?&quot;
The teacher replied &quot;That's a great question! Write it down.&quot;</p><p>Having never been told this by other teachers, the student was confused. &quot;Huh?&quot;
The teacher repeats, &quot;Write it down.&quot; He continues to lecture.</p><p>Student, &quot;But you're the teacher! You should know and tell me!&quot;
Teacher nods with understanding. Yet, he continues to lecture.</p><p>Student looks at the notebook with a pen at hand. The question was unlikely written. &quot;Now what?&quot;
Again, the teacher nods while lecturing.
The student  becomes visibly frustrated but must catch up.</p><p>The teacher. He may have known. He may have not. That wasn't the point.
Hardly anyone wrote the questions down.
Our grade-obsessed, feeble minds weren't able to humor his low-grade, zen-master tricks.</p></div><div id="footer"><br />
