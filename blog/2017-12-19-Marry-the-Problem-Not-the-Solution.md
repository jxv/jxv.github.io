# Marry the Problem; Not the Solution

There is a growing sense of guilt that awaits while undoing what was believed to be valuable work.
Being held back by pride is a good first indicator to push more.

People excel at ignoring the surrounding irrelevant to their problems.
This idea was demonstrated years ago when the moon walking bear video went viral.
A good problem solver is focused, which spends some emotional energy.

This kind of emotionally investment is a double edge sword.
First, it’s requirement because a high level of emotional engagement is needed to create quality work.

Second, the real risk begins when the investing in the solution becomes more important than the solving process.
Though it’s understandable. Sunk cost fallacy — having something that already kind of works is difficult to let go.
Doesn’t matter if changing is the “right” thing to do.

It’s important to remember that the core problem rarely changes; however, its context and the understanding of it will change over time.
Understanding is half the process.
And context doesn’t exist in isolation.
t violently changes more than the problem itself.

If there’s an argument to heed in this post, it’s this one.
The true and dangerous damages to avoid are the effects of tunnel vision and overexertion.
And both feed rapidly and happily off each other.
Recognizing it immediately and recovering from it is very wise.
Though it’s wiser to avoid the effects entirely.

The best, long-term, and preventive antidote is a routine with planned leisure activities, exercise, and consistent sleep times.
Hopefully, none of that is a surprise.
With whatever creative endeavor taken up, this is just a reminder.

The long haul of the solution is its process.
The process is showing up consistently with clarity of vision, uninterrupted time blocks, focused calmness, and expressive energy.
Protect it obsequiously.
